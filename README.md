## Abstract
A commonly held background assumption about the sciences is, that they are organised in a hierarchical structure, which usually is thought to follow the order: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, and the social sciences, with interdisciplinary work arising in the bordering regions of adjacent disciplines. Philosophical research into interdisciplinary model transfer has increasingly complicated this picture. But most of these works have been done through case studies, which due to their limited scope are hard-pressed to provide foundations for claims about large-scale relations between multiple scientific disciplines. As an alternative, in this contribution, we propose to philosophers of science the use of modern science mapping techniques to trace connections between modelling techniques in large samples of the literature. We explain in detail how these techniques work, and apply them to a large, contemporary and multidisciplinary data set (n=383.961 articles). Through the comparison of textual to mathematical representations, we suggest formulaic structures that are particularly common among different disciplines and produce first results indicating the general strength and commonality of such relationships.
